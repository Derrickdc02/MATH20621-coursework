# MATH20621-coursework
This repository contains my courseworks for MATH20621: Programming with Python. It covers core programming fundamentals, simulation with randomness, and a small card/solitaire-style game implementation. Only my own work is included; no official course handouts, solutions, or proprietary materials are redistributed.
